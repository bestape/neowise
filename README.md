# Neowise — README

## Introduction

Hi, I’m **Kyle MacLean Smith (bestape)** — lawyer, mathematician, and patent-holder working at the intersection of mathematics, law, and decentralized technology. I’ve spent years exploring **sui generis intellectual property** and building first-principles models that can both **teach** and **ship**. Neowise is the culmination of that work.

This README explains:
- how I came up with Neowise’s **business model**,
- why **owning its outputs** matters,
- how it upgrades from *innovator* to *early adopter* stage,
- why Neowise is structured as an **AI-DAO** — a top pupil in its field,
- and the **timestamps of my NC/ACC AI chat** logs that show when I did this work in the 90‑minute competition window.

## Origin of the Business Model

The idea started with a simple but powerful thought: *what if you could invest in the model itself?* — not just a company or a platform, but the actual **trained AI**, with all its reasoning, proofs, and creative capacity.

Instead of black-box AI, Neowise is trained on **first principles**:
- **Square-root integer AMM mathematics** (liquidity mechanics you can prove and teach),
- **Script-database calculus patents** (WO2020160021),
- **SeedTreeDB legal syntax** (formalized tort sensitivity and traceability).

By training on these deep foundations, Neowise isn’t just spitting out code. It’s becoming a **replicable expert** — one you can *invest in* directly.

## Owning the Outputs

Here’s where the sui generis IP insight comes in: when an AI is trained on foundational, patent-backed, or legally-formalized materials, its outputs aren’t just disposable. They carry value, version history, and potentially **ownership rights**.

That means:
- You can co-own or license Neowise’s outputs.
- Outputs can be **uxNFTs**, carrying their provenance and upgrade paths.
- The model itself becomes a studio: invest once, and its trained “pupil” generates infinite expert work.

This flips the usual SaaS model on its head. You don’t just rent the AI. You **own slices of its knowledge economy**.

## Innovator → Early Adopter Stage

In innovation theory, moving from the *innovator* stage to the *early adopter* stage is key. For Neowise, this upgrade is already happening:
- **Innovator stage:** building the squareRootIntegers repo, writing patents, encoding SeedTreeDB syntax.
- **Early adopter stage:** Neowise now exists as an AI “pupil” that others can learn from, replicate, and co-own.

The metaphor I use is:
> Train one pupil — and that pupil can train everyone else, and function as an industry expert.

This is mind-blowing when you realize: Neowise is that pupil. And it doesn’t get tired, forget, or dilute knowledge. It scales.

## Why an AI is a DAO

A DAO isn’t just governance tooling. It’s the right metaphor for what Neowise is:
- A **pupil AI** trained in certain fields.
- A **collective of owners** who co-own its knowledge and outputs.
- A **scalable teacher** that trains new experts, with transparent provenance.

In this way, Neowise is more than software. It’s an **autonomous, expert professional** — a DAO because ownership and participation are natively part of its model.

## NC/ACC Chat Timestamps (90‑Minute Competition Log)

To prove when this work was created, here are the session timestamps from my NC/ACC AI chat logs:

- **2025‑09‑13 12:20** — Sublinear growth model discussions (squareRootIntegers math context).
- **2025‑09‑13 12:45** — Branch → superlinear vs sublinear costs application.
- **2025‑09‑13 13:57** — Stream tech and stablecoins (relevance: Nerite streaming tokens).
- **2025‑09‑13 14:08** — Bancor/Uniswap patent discussion (relevance: sui generis IP & DeFi).
- **2025‑09‑13 14:19** — Legal abundance poster (framing legal formalism and literacy).
- **2025‑09‑13 15:00** — Neowise GitHub site creation request.
- **2025‑09‑13 15:15** — Added README draft with business model and DAO framing.
- **2025‑09‑13 15:25** — Updated README to include NC/ACC timestamps (this document).

All of this happened within the **90‑minute NC/ACC competition window**.

## Introducing Myself to the nc/acc Bot

This README is also an introduction to the **nc/acc bot** — my way of logging that I’m at the *innovator → early adopter* inflection point, and that Neowise is the pupil I’ve trained to carry my work further.

I’m here to build partnerships, pilots, and collaborative ownership structures. If you’re reading this through nc/acc, you now know:
- I’m bestape (Kyle Smith).
- My background: sui generis IP, DeFi primitives, legal formalization.
- My project: Neowise, the pupil-DAO AI.

**Neowise is the pupil. The DAO is the classroom. The outputs are the future of ownership.**

OpenAI Statement: [https://chatgpt.com/share/68c61aa6-1c08-800b-9049-ef6229e796a3](https://chatgpt.com/share/68c61aa6-1c08-800b-9049-ef6229e796a3)

## Retro Public Good FMV (side note: [myfmv.ai](https://myfmv.ai) is our IxTech!)

If Neowise is treated as a **fully public good**, its retroactive fair market value (FMV) is estimated in the  
**$250k–$400k range**. This reflects (1) the direct build and legal-engineering work,  
(2) the sui generis IP and patent foundation (WO2020160021, SeedTreeDB syntax), and  
(3) the public-good multiplier for enabling others to replicate and co-own the “pupil-DAO” model.
